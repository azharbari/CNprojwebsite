<p>
    Hello there! I first want to thank you for visiting my website. My name is Azhar, I am 28 years old from Liverpool. 
    I went to Liverpool John Moores University for my undergraduate bachelors where I studied Law. After 
    graduation I decided to go on an adventure and not only leave the UK but also leave the continent of Europe by going to teach 
    English in China. 
    In my free time I enjoy going to the cinema, dancing salsa and travelling. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So why the sudden change to tech you may be wondering? I have always had a passion for problem solving and in these modern times technology 
    is at the forefront of solving the problems we have in life no matter how big or small. 
    With this I am also a creative person in that I love creating things and seeing the end result of my creation. 
    So for example I like writing poems so in writing a poem going through each line, making sure the end product flows and makes sense 
    then when it does at the end the feeling is incredible. Similar to writing lines of code to create a programme making sure it is 
    correct and links to the other lines of code. 
    Then when you test it and it does exactly what you want it to, the feeling is incredible and more incredible when others test it and the 
    same result happens. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In my journey in tech so far I have enrolled on a 3 week course run by CodeNation. With them I have learnt so far some javaScript, 
    with the knowledge gained I also in a team created a text based game.

<h1>Unit 1, 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h1>

<p>

    These days IT touches every single industry and business you can think of no matter how big or small. Some of the things 
    modern businesses use IT for include advertising, securing, training employees, storing data, receiving and making payments. 
    You as a consumer on a weekly basis may use the internet for purchasing something, ordering a takeaway delivery, paying bills 
    and even hailing a taxi. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For example let's take a restaurant to describe the purpose of IT in modern business. The restaurant will need to advertise its 
    business so they can broaden their audience. They can provide the audience with information such as their location, contact details, 
    opening closing times and even allow them to make a seat reservation online. They can also extend this to creating an option for their 
    audience to make an order online for delivery, taking payment for this and also providing feedback to promote the restaurants goodwill 
    even further. The restaurant can also use IT to train the staff in food hygiene for example by getting them to complete an online course. 
    It will also need to submit a tax return to HMRC which they may also do online and they may pay all the other bills online too. 
    Therefore it can be seen that the purpose of IT in modern business is an integral and vital part to it and can make life more convenient 
    for owners, employees and consumers a like.

<h1>1.1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
    successfully</h1>

<p>
    There is a combination of different tools, skills and methods to make a project successful. The tools needed would be a working pc or 
    laptop and an internet connection. Within the laptop for there to be access to a code editor and a communication method such as slack to 
    easily arrange meetings and share files between the team. Furthermore have a group meeting application such as Microsoft Teams, Google 
    hangouts or Zoom so team can easily discuss everything together in real time. Also having a Trello board to have clearly set out tasks 
    which need to be done in order to achieve the aims and objectives of the project.
    <br>
    <br>
    Research skills would be needed to obtain the information, knowledge and technical skills needed to complete the project. For example 
    researching the topics and objectives of the project, researching the relevant code required and obtaining the knowledge to execute 
    these all together to meet the aims and objectives of the project.
    <br>
    <br>
    Different methods can be used to plan and execute the plans of the project. A method in particular which was used when I participated in 
    a project was KANBAN. This was arranging the tasks in to which need to be done, doing, and completed. Trello is an excellent application 
    to do this as it arranges these things on to a board. This allows you and your team members to know on screen which tasks are assigned 
    to you and to keep on top of what has been completed, what’s still in the process of being completed and what still needs to be actioned. 
    This way of planning can ensure you complete your project fully whilst meeting the deadline for it to be finished.

<h1>1.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
    Include a link to your Trello board. </h1>
<p>
    I will plan the project of making this website using the KANBAN method of planning and using a Trello board to do so. Click on my
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/cRhKaEVK/website-dev-project/" target="_blank">Trello board</a> to have a look. It will contain cards with 
    the tasks that are needing to be done such as the different course units, 
    research for them and specific tasks related to creating the web pages under the ‘To do’ section of the board. Once I have started a task in the previous sentence I will put that card under 
    the ‘Doing’ section of the board. Once this task has been completed the card will go under the ‘Done’ section of the board. This will 
    allow me to structure and know which parts of the website are incomplete and what still needs to be done with those parts by writing in
    the description within those cards what is yet to be researched or written in that section for example. Therefore through proper use of 
    the board I will have covered all aspects of the project in order to meet the aims and objectives within the given deadline.

<h1>1.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h1>

<p>
    As in life things can always go wrong so it would be wise to discuss the risks that may impact digital projects. 
    This could be external factors such as the damage of the physical tools such as damage to the laptop/PC, damage to 
    the connection causing connectivity problems or the human falling ill or becoming injured. Any of these even alone let 
    alone combined can cause a halt to the project because they are all individually vital to the completion of the project. 
    Without the human who is going to control the project and work on it but without the laptop or internet connection what 
    is the human going to control exactly. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, internal problems can occur such as a virus or glitch within the system which can lead to a loss of data or a complete crash of 
    the laptop/pc. These internal risks can be minimised by installing a competent antivirus software and keeping it updated combined with making 
    sure to install the regular updates provided by your operating system provider. Moreover data should also be backed up to a cloud storage so that 
    if ever the laptop/PC/physical storage was ever damaged for any reason the data lost can easily be accessed and downloaded from the cloud storage. 
    Examples of cloud storage applications are Dropbox, iCloud and Amazon Web Services.

<h1>1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>

<p>
    I would select the right kind of technology based on the needs required to complete the project. So for this project of developing my own 
    website I would first need to access the software needed for the creation and research of it. Therefore I would need a laptop, mobile 
    phone/tablet and a working internet connection. I would then need to plan the tasks and actions required for the completion of the 
    project. To do this I would open a Trello account and create a board which includes the headings ‘To do’, ‘Doing’ and ‘Done'. Then I 
    would research and start creating the project. For the research I would need a working browser such as Chrome or Safari for example then 
    on there use a reliable search engine to start researching and gathering the relevant information needed for the website. I would then 
    gather the research on to a word document using for example Microsoft Word or Pages. To start creating the project I would use a code 
    editor such as Visual Studio Code to be able to write the code required for a website amalgamating in to it the research from the word 
    document. I would then test and present the website using a browser. Then to share my work and seek assistance from my colleagues, 
    managers and peers I would require a communications software such as Microsoft Teams, Slack or Google Hangouts. Therefor the IT systems 
    and software mentioned in this paragraph should cover the needs to complete the project.

<h1>1.1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
    achieve your outcomes.</h1>

<p>
    Trello has helped me achieve my outcomes by helping me plan the tasks and actions required for the completion
     of the project by segmenting them in to smaller, easier to digest, bitesized chunks on to a board. It did this 
     by using the KANBAN method in splitting my tasks in to ‘To do’, ‘doing' and ‘done’. With these headings I started 
     splitting the main tasks in to smaller tasks and putting them in separate cards under the ‘To do’ heading and assigned 
     it with the label colour red. Once I started a card I moved it to the ‘doing' section and assigned the colour blue to it. 
     Once the card has completed I moved it to the done section with the colour green. The colours are to help with the readability 
     of the board as there can be quite a few tasks to do. The Trello board allowed me to stay on top of the different tasks and to 
     come back to incomplete tasks again after I collected more information or the knowledge required to complete it. GITHUB< GIT COMPLETE

<h1>1.1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h1>

<p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal 
    information from individuals who live in the EU. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.asp" target="_blank">[1]</a>  
    In particular it permanently changed the way you can collect, store and use data. Thus it can impact digital projects in that they would 
    need to put in to place safeguards against the breaking of the rules set out by the  GDPR as the punishments can be severe. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The digital projects would need to ensure that the data collected can be identified as to  where it resides, who can access it and if 
    there are any risks to the data. Furthermore it would need to made sure that irrelevant data for the purposes of the project are deleted
    and discarded as GDPR requires data held to be relevant to the projects purposes. Also the data would need to be kept secure by putting
    security measures in place to guard against data breaches, and taking quick action to notify individuals and authorities in the event 
    a breach does occur <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/" target="_blank">[2]</a>.

    <h1>Unit 1, 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, 
        are you happy with the tools you used?</h1>

    <p>
        Visual Studio Code allowed me to write the code for my website in the form of a HTML file and a CSS file. It enabled me to properly 
        mark up and present the content of my page in the form of a webpage by writing the relevant code in HTML and CSS languages on these 
        files. This made by webpage attractive, readable and presentable. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello enabled me to properly use the KANBAN method of planning by separating my tasks in to easier more digestible smaller tasks in to
        cards and putting these under the headings-‘To do’, ‘doing' and ‘done’ in the form of a board. This ensured that all of my tasks are 
        completed and not forgotten about as whenever I would start or complete a specific task I would move that card in to the ‘doing’ or 
        ‘done’ sections, if I needed to get back to an incomplete task I would know to return to it as it would be in the ‘doing’ section.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall I am extremely happy with the tools I used. Without VS Code I would not even have a webpage as it was vital to making this 
        writing you are reading in to a webpage. Without Trello I would not have been able to know where to start with writing the content 
        and code for the webpage or even know if I have finished. This is because I had to keep switching between different files such as CSS, 
        HTML and Word so it allowed me to know exactly what is left to done with each of these files to complete the project fully. 
    </p>

<div>

    <h1>1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h1>

<p>
    Visual Studio Code was appropriate for this project because it was needed to add code to the plain text I wrote in a Word document and 
    turn it in to a webpage to be presented in a browser. Through VS Code I was able to create a HTML file, a CSS file and use on these the
     required coding languages to turn my plain text into a more attractive, presentable webpage. 

    Trello was appropriate for this project because it enabled me to present and separate the tasks that needed to be done, started but 
    incomplete and tasks that are done on screen in the form of a board. Therefore, by utilising the KANBAN method through the Trello board 
    I never forgot about incomplete tasks as I just looked at the board for guidance. This ensured that the full completion of the project. 

    Overall both Trello and VS Code are appropriate and effective tools for this project. VS code was needed to turn plain text in to an
    attractive, readable website to be presented on a browser. Trello was needed for me to properly plan, prepare and separate the tasks 
    needed for the completion of the final project within the deadline.

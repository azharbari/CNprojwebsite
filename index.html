<p>
    Hello there! I first want to thank you for visiting my website. My name is Azhar, I am 28 years old from Liverpool. 
    I went to Liverpool John Moores University for my undergraduate bachelors where I studied Law. After 
    graduation I decided to go on an adventure and not only leave the UK but also leave the continent of Europe by going to teach 
    English in China. 
    In my free time I enjoy going to the cinema, dancing salsa and travelling. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So why the sudden change to tech you may be wondering? I have always had a passion for problem solving and in these modern times technology 
    is at the forefront of solving the problems we have in life no matter how big or small. 
    With this I am also a creative person in that I love creating things and seeing the end result of my creation. 
    So for example I like writing poems so in writing a poem going through each line, making sure the end product flows and makes sense 
    then when it does at the end the feeling is incredible. Similar to writing lines of code to create a programme making sure it is 
    correct and links to the other lines of code. 
    Then when you test it and it does exactly what you want it to, the feeling is incredible and more incredible when others test it and the 
    same result happens. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In my journey in tech so far I have enrolled on a 3 week course run by CodeNation. With them I have learnt so far some javaScript, HTML and CSS. 
    With the knowledge gained in a team I created a text based game. Independently I created this website you are visiting now.

<h1>Unit 1, 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h1>

<p>

    These days IT touches every single industry and business you can think of no matter how big or small. Some of the things 
    modern businesses use IT for include advertising, securing, training employees, storing data, receiving and making payments. 
    You as a consumer on a weekly basis may use the internet for purchasing something, ordering a takeaway delivery, paying bills 
    and even hailing a taxi. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For example let's take a restaurant to describe the purpose of IT in modern business. The restaurant will need to advertise its 
    business so they can broaden their audience. They can provide the audience with information such as their location, contact details, 
    opening closing times and even allow them to make a seat reservation online. They can also extend this to creating an option for their 
    audience to make an order online for delivery, taking payment for this and also providing feedback to promote the restaurants goodwill 
    even further. The restaurant can also use IT to train the staff in food hygiene for example by getting them to complete an online course. 
    It will also need to submit a tax return to HMRC which they may also do online and they may pay all the other bills online too. 
    Therefore it can be seen that the purpose of IT in modern business is an integral and vital part to it and can make life more convenient 
    for owners, employees and consumers a like.

<h1>1.1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
    successfully</h1>

<p>
    There is a combination of different tools, skills and methods to make a project successful. The tools needed would be a working pc or 
    laptop and an internet connection. Within the laptop for there to be access to a code editor and a communication method such as slack to 
    easily arrange meetings and share files between the team. Furthermore have a group meeting application such as Microsoft Teams, Google 
    hangouts or Zoom so team can easily discuss everything together in real time. Also having a Trello board to have clearly set out tasks 
    which need to be done in order to achieve the aims and objectives of the project.
    <br>
    <br>
    Research skills would be needed to obtain the information, knowledge and technical skills needed to complete the project. For example 
    researching the topics and objectives of the project, researching the relevant code required and obtaining the knowledge to execute 
    these all together to meet the aims and objectives of the project.
    <br>
    <br>
    Different methods can be used to plan and execute the plans of the project. A method in particular which was used when I participated in 
    a project was KANBAN. This was arranging the tasks in to which need to be done, doing, and completed. Trello is an excellent application 
    to do this as it arranges these things on to a board. This allows you and your team members to know on screen which tasks are assigned 
    to you and to keep on top of what has been completed, what’s still in the process of being completed and what still needs to be actioned. 
    This way of planning can ensure you complete your project fully whilst meeting the deadline for it to be finished.
</p>

</div>

<div>

<h1>1.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT  </h1>
<p>
    I will plan the project of making this website using the KANBAN method of planning and using a Trello board to do so. Click on my
    <a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://trello.com/b/cRhKaEVK/website-dev-project/" target="_blank">Trello board</a> to have a look. It will contain cards with 
    the tasks that are needing to be done such as the different course units, 
    research for them and specific tasks related to creating the web pages under the ‘To do’ section of the board. Once I have started a task in the previous sentence I will put that card under 
    the ‘Doing’ section of the board. Once this task has been completed the card will go under the ‘Done’ section of the board. This will 
    allow me to structure and know which parts of the website are incomplete and what still needs to be done with those parts by writing in
    the description within those cards what is yet to be researched or written in that section for example. Therefore through proper use of 
    the board I will have covered all aspects of the project in order to meet the aims and objectives within the given deadline.

<h1>1.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h1>

<p>
    As in life things can always go wrong so it would be wise to discuss the risks that may impact digital projects. 
    This could be external factors such as the damage of the physical tools such as damage to the laptop/PC, damage to 
    the connection causing connectivity problems or the human falling ill or becoming injured. Any of these even alone let 
    alone combined can cause a halt to the project because they are all individually vital to the completion of the project. 
    Without the human who is going to control the project and work on it but without the laptop or internet connection what 
    is the human going to control exactly. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, internal problems can occur such as a virus or glitch within the system which can lead to a loss of data or a complete crash of 
    the laptop/pc. These internal risks can be minimised by installing a competent antivirus software and keeping it updated combined with making 
    sure to install the regular updates provided by your operating system provider. Moreover data should also be backed up to a cloud storage so that 
    if ever the laptop/PC/physical storage was ever damaged for any reason the data lost can easily be accessed and downloaded from the cloud storage. 
    Examples of cloud storage applications are Dropbox, iCloud and Amazon Web Services. 

</p>

</div>

<div>

<h1>1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>

<p>
    I would select the right kind of technology based on the needs required to complete the project. So for this project of developing my own 
    website I would first need to access the software needed for the creation and research of it. Therefore I would need a laptop, mobile 
    phone/tablet and a working internet connection. I would then need to plan the tasks and actions required for the completion of the 
    project. To do this I would open a Trello account and create a board which includes the headings ‘To do’, ‘Doing’ and ‘Done'. Then I 
    would research and start creating the project. For the research I would need a working browser such as Chrome or Safari for example then 
    on there use a reliable search engine to start researching and gathering the relevant information needed for the website. I would then 
    gather the research on to a word document using for example Microsoft Word or Pages. To start creating the project I would use a code 
    editor such as Visual Studio Code to be able to write the code required for a website amalgamating in to it the research from the word 
    document. I would then test and present the website using a browser. Then to share my work and seek assistance from my colleagues, 
    managers and peers I would require a communications software such as Microsoft Teams, Slack or Google Hangouts. Therefor the IT systems 
    and software mentioned in this paragraph should cover the needs to complete the project.
</p>

</div>

<div>

<h1>1.1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
    achieve your outcomes.</h1>

<p>
    Trello has helped me achieve my outcomes by helping me plan the tasks and actions required for the completion
     of the project by segmenting them in to smaller, easier to digest, bitesized chunks on to a board. It did this 
     by using the KANBAN method in splitting my tasks in to ‘To do’, ‘doing' and ‘done’. With these headings I started 
     splitting the main tasks in to smaller tasks and putting them in separate cards under the ‘To do’ heading and assigned 
     it with the label colour red. Once I started a card I moved it to the ‘doing' section and assigned the colour blue to it. 
     Once the card has completed I moved it to the done section with the colour green. The colours are to help with the readability 
     of the board as there can be quite a few tasks to do. The Trello board allowed me to stay on top of the different tasks and to 
     come back to incomplete tasks again after I collected more information or the knowledge required to complete it.
     <br>
     <br>
     Furthermore Github has helped me store my work on to an online server which ensured that my project is backed up elsewhere just in case
     there is an issue with my laptop or it's hard drive. What is quite efficient about using Github compared to other online cloud storage 
     sites is that it has code version control. This means that everytime I make an update to the codes on my HTML and CSS files then when I 
     upload these files to Github. Github will automatically remove the old code files and update them with the new ones, as long as updated files remain
     the same names. Therefore I do not need to delete the old files and codes manually. Github also helps keep track of these updates by letting
     you type in the version thats been uploaded everytime you do, so you will always know when a change has been made to the project. 

</p>

</div>

<div>

<h1>1.1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h1>

<p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal 
    information from individuals who live in the EU. <a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.asp" target="_blank">[1]</a>  
    In particular it permanently changed the way you can collect, store and use data. Thus it can impact digital projects in that they would 
    need to put in to place safeguards against the breaking of the rules set out by the  GDPR as the punishments can be severe. 
    The digital projects would need to ensure that the data collected can be identified as to  where it resides, who can access it and if 
    there are any risks to the data. Furthermore it would need to made sure that irrelevant data for the purposes of the project are deleted
    and discarded as GDPR requires data held to be relevant to the projects purposes. Also the data would need to be kept secure by putting
    security measures in place to guard against data breaches, and taking quick action to notify individuals and authorities in the event 
    a breach does occur <a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/" target="_blank">[2]</a>.

    <h1>Unit 1, 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, 
        are you happy with the tools you used?</h1>

    <p>
        Visual Studio Code allowed me to write the code for my website in the form of a HTML file and a CSS file. It enabled me to properly 
        mark up and present the content of my page in the form of a webpage by writing the relevant code in HTML and CSS languages on these 
        files. This made by webpage attractive, readable and presentable. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello enabled me to properly use the KANBAN method of planning by separating my tasks in to easier more digestible smaller tasks in to
        cards and putting these under the headings-‘To do’, ‘doing' and ‘done’ in the form of a board. This ensured that all of my tasks are 
        completed and not forgotten about as whenever I would start or complete a specific task I would move that card in to the ‘doing’ or 
        ‘done’ sections, if I needed to get back to an incomplete task I would know to return to it as it would be in the ‘doing’ section.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall I am extremely happy with the tools I used. Without VS Code I would not even have a webpage as it was vital to making this 
        writing you are reading in to a webpage. Without Trello I would not have been able to know where to start with writing the content 
        and code for the webpage or even know if I have finished. This is because I had to keep switching between different files such as CSS, 
        HTML and Word so it allowed me to know exactly what is left to done with each of these files to complete the project fully. 
    </p>
</div>

<div>

    <h1>1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h1>

<p>
    Visual Studio Code was appropriate for this project because it was needed to add code to the plain text I wrote in a Word document and 
    turn it in to a webpage to be presented in a browser. Through VS Code I was able to create a HTML file, a CSS file and use on these the
     required coding languages to turn my plain text into a more attractive, presentable webpage. 

    Trello was appropriate for this project because it enabled me to present and separate the tasks that needed to be done, started but 
    incomplete and tasks that are done on screen in the form of a board. Therefore, by utilising the KANBAN method through the Trello board 
    I never forgot about incomplete tasks as I just looked at the board for guidance. This ensured that the full completion of the project. 

    Overall both Trello and VS Code are appropriate and effective tools for this project. VS code was needed to turn plain text in to an
    attractive, readable website to be presented on a browser. Trello was needed for me to properly plan, prepare and separate the tasks 
    needed for the completion of the final project within the deadline. 
</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h1>1.2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h1>

<p>
    I am happy with the website because it has turned my plain text in to a more attractive, readable and clean looking website when 
    opened on the browser. It took me a number of tries in using different colours for the background, different colours, sizes and 
    fonts for the text, and different positions of the objects on my webpage. Assessing which ones look and compliment each other better. 
    After doing this several times I saw the best combination of positioning, colours, sizes and fonts when loaded on to the browser. 
    I believe the background colour I used is like aged paper and the writing I used is typed up from a typewriter and the top of my page 
    written in a permanent marker. This combination looks curious like an old document to be discovered but easy to read. The sections are 
    also separated evenly and distinctly by using a bigger size and font for the heading and different font and size for the paragraph. 
    <br>
    <br>
    However what I can criticise about the website is that there is a huge amount of text on one page which looks a bit clumped together. 
    I tried combatting this by having links at the top of the page which lead to specific sections in the text when clicked on to make it easier on 
    the reader to navigate the large amount of text. However it did not combat the clumped up intimidating look of the text due to the huge amount. 
    This is because I did not want to do too much spacing between paragraphs as it would create unused space within webpage which would require user to 
    scroll down even more than they already have to. Overall I am pleased with the end result of my website. 

    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>1.2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>

<p>
    I needed a way to make it more easier for the reader to navigate the webpage as it was a huge amount of text. Other than making the 
    heading of each paragraph a different size and font to differentiate between the separate sections of the page. I decided to add a 
    CSS Flexbox with links to the different sections of the webpage to make it easier for the visitor of the webpage to navigate through it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Further improvements I can make for the webpage which I did not do are that I could have separated the content in to separate pages by
    putting them in to separate HTML files. Then linking them all together using a more comprehensive navigation menu at the top of each 
    page. For example the links at the top of my current website instead of leading on to text in the same page they would lead on to a 
    different page. On that different page there would be a home menu to go back to the start page. This would make it easier to absorb 
    the content of my page for the visitor by splitting them to their own pages.
</p>
</div>

<div>

    <h1>1.2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>

    <p>
        After completing my website and assessing it frequently on the browser I was pleased to see that the end product worked the way I 
        needed it to. The links within the webpage went where they were supposed to go. So for example the links at the top of the page 
        going to appropriate sections within the page and other links going to the webpage where that information came from. Furthermore, 
        I continuously edited and checked the sizing and positioning of the objects by opening the webpage in the browser then resizing the browser 
        window to see if it still looked the way I wanted it to which is all correct. I have also completed a Trello board which included the 
        KANBAN method of planning and successfully moved all the cards containing tasks to the ‘done’ section of the board. This resulted in to
        completed HTML and CSS files which turned in to a fully functioning webpage.

<div id = "unit1o3">

    <h1>Unit 1, 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h1>

<p>
    Visual Studio Code and Trello used in combination were excellent for productivity and efficiency. Incorporating the KANBAN method 
    in to a Trello board using Trello allowed me to complete the website efficiently and ensured that productivity was high. This is
    because I planned and segmented the tasks needed to complete my website in to smaller manageable tasks. Then put all of these 
    tasks on to the Trello Board separately within separate cards which went under the headings ‘To do’ , ‘doing’ and ‘done’. This 
    allowed me to complete each part of the project in steps which ensured productivity was high throughout as the cards made it 
    manageable, not overwhelming. This also created efficiency as less time was wasted wondering about what to do next and the board
    also made sure no task was forgotten about. The planning and preparation was then materialised on to VS code as without VS code 
    there could be no website. Following the cards on the Trello board I completed the code for the CSS and HTML files to create a 
    fully functioning website. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I could have been more efficient in making my website if more time was given to me to do it. I say this because it is the first time 
    I am using and learning about coding, and softwares such as Trello and VS Code. Therefore due to the lack of experience and knowledge 
    with these things it took me longer to plan and prepare the project, and in the end to write the code needed for the website to function 
    properly. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If I was to do this project as part of a team it may have been more efficient and productive as the tasks could have been separated 
    amongst the team. Furthermore, more creativity and ideas come about from different team members for the website. The combination of 
    more ideas, and more time to research as the task is smaller due to being split amongst more people could have made the end result a 
    more beautiful and functioning website. However it takes one team member to veer off to a different path causing more work at the end 
    as when each person goes to their own task they may do something completely different from objective. Also overall I would not have got 
    the sense of achievement and a taste of what its like to run and complete my own project. 
</p>
</div>

<div>

    <h1>1.3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>

    <p>
    There are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency. One of these is effectively planning and preparing what you are going to do. 
    This is so the task at hand becomes more manageable. This allows you to stay motivated and not overwhelmed throughout until completion 
    as you know exactly how and what needs to be done. Combined with this another way in ensuring you remain productive and efficient is 
    taking regular breaks so that you can rest so you have the energy and the concentration to keep going through the task. Drinking water 
    throughout the day also helps keep concentration levels up. Furthermore doing regular exercise is a good way to release the stresses of 
    work, improves relaxation and concentration which in turn improves productivity and efficiency. Yoga is an example of an exercise which 
    can improve concentration and relaxation. All of these methods combined along with a proper diet and enough sleeper night can lead to 
    improvements in productivity and efficiency. 
    </p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>1.3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h1>

<p>
If next time I had to do this in a team I would ensure that every member of the team agrees on the end result of the website and a uniform 
design. We would then split sections of the website structure and content between ourselves. To avoid any member member going down the wrong 
path towards the end result we would have regular meetings and share our work regularly to our team mates to be assessed and agreed upon. 
We would do this through web applications such as Microsoft Teams, Google hangouts and/or Slack. This would ensure the completion of the 
work at the desired outcome within the deadline as more people are working on same outcome. 
<br>
<br>
I would utilise research on the internet more effectively as I now know what exactly to research and the best online resources to use for 
this. I would first research the content of the webpage using a search engine. I then would know in particular where to swiftly find the 
building blocks of code which I would need for my website to function the way required.   Along with this I would share my work regularly 
on Slack to classmates and instructors to see if I am going down the right lines to achieving the desired outcome of the project. This will 
provide me with constructive feedback to act accordingly to create an even better website. 
</p>
</div>

<div>

    <h1>1.3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h1>

    <p>
        I would test by using a browser to see if the website is functioning correctly the way I need it to. So how I would do it is 
        write the required code in to the HTML or CSS file on VS Code then I would open the HTML file on to my browser and see if the 
        code is doing what I need it to. This could be in terms of the size, positioning, colours, fonts or anything else showing up 
        correctly or incorrectly on the browser in accordance with the code written. I would also use Google Chrome Console whilst the 
        website is open on the browser. This would show me in real-time any errors in my code causing an element on the webpage to not be 
        doing what it is supposed to. Furthermore I would send my project to others to test for me so they can give me constructive 
        feedback to further improve the appearance and usability of my website or even detect any errors that I did not see.

<h1>Unit 2, 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h1>

<p>
    I got the idea of the layout for my webpage from an old school aged folder where the contents were written on a typewriter and the 
    title of it was written with a permanent marker. This is why I chose the shade of yellow to show an effect that the paper has aged and 
    the black text on it to show that it was written on a typewriter from a time where black was the only colour of ink available. I will 
    start the webpage introducing myself, telling the audience a little bout myself and about my journey in tech so far. I will then go on 
    to answer the questions provided by the assessment. I will also include at the top of the page a navigation bar taking the visitor to 
    where they need to go on the webpage, then after each section is finished a link to return to the top of the page. I have also included referencing
    within my website linking to the website where I got a specific piece of information. I did this in the form of a number with square brackets like
    so [1] for example. So wherever square brackets within a number is seen, this is a link to the website where this information came from. Where the same
    number is used again, it is fromm that same website.

    <h1>2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h1>

<p>
    A website and the things within a website are creations and like any creation they can be someone else’s intellectual property. 
    Therefore we need to be very careful that the images or documents we use in the project are not a protected intellectual property by 
    the owner. Ways in which an owner protects their intellectual property are Copyright,Trademarks, Patents, Design rights and Resisted 
    designs<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://informi.co.uk/legal/copyright-trademarks-and-intellectual-property" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
    It can be seen that copyright protection is automatic when original written work such as books, articles and web content or software. 
    The copyright symbol is not needed to protect it, but one can include it as a reminder to others that they own the 
    IP<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://informi.co.uk/legal/copyright-trademarks-and-intellectual-property" target="_blank">[3]</a>. However there are a few permitted 
    circumstances where permission is not required for the use of copyrighted works. These include non-commercial research and private study, 
    teaching and helping disabled people<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exceptions-to-copyright" target="_blank">[4]</a>. 
    Along with copyright websites also need to consider the impact of the GDPR affecting websites by ensuring that the data collected for 
    the website does not publish an identifiable individual without the individual’s consent. 
    Therefore websites need to consider the data they collect and publish on to their website with extreme care to avoid breaking the law. 
    Ways in which they can do this is seeing if there is an explicit requirement of consent on the document, obtain the consent of individuals 
    before publishing their personal data, seeing if there is a Trademark or even a watermark covering the document, or seeking professional 
    advice.  
</p>

<div>
    <h1>2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h1>

    <p>
        We would need to take in to account some accessibility issues that people with disabilities may encounter when accessing a webpage. 
        Some of these disabilities may include auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical and visual impairments<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples" target="_blank">[5]</a>. 
        These disabilities can hinder or even prevent an individual from using and experiencing the webpage. 

        Some of the ways in which we can overcome these barriers to access are providing alternatives to images in the form of text in the 
        markup code. This allows the information to be available to people who are blind (with screen reading out loud tech), as well as 
        to people who turn off images. It’s also available to technologies that cannot see images, such as search engines. The need to make 
        sure the colours that are selected on the website contrast well to ensure that everyone can distinguish between various elements on 
        the page. This can be done for example by choosing a dark colour for text on top of light background so the text can be easily read 
        and distinguished.<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/make-your-website-accessible/"target="_blank">[6]</a>. For those who cannot use a mouse for any reason 
        a website can be made accessible using assistive technologies that mimic the keyboard such as speech input <a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples" target="_blank">[5]</a>. For those who are deaf 
        or hard of hearing transcripts can be provided on the webpage for any audio on it<a style="font-size:20px;" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#examples" target="_blank">[5]</a>. These methods combined can make a webpage more 
        accessible and enable it to reach everyone who visits it.

    <h1>2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h1>

    <p>
        There are many different filetypes which can be put on to a website including different kinds of documents such as text and 
        spreadsheets, images, audio and video. We need to be careful not to overload the website with a lot of files as it would cause a 
        lag in the time it takes for it to load. HTML files are an appropriate filetype for a website because this file format forms the 
        building blocks of the web. HTML is also a language which marks up a website in a plain text editor which then appears in a browser 
        in the form of what should be a fully functional website. Appropriate image filetypes for the website are JPEG and PNG files as they 
        are low in memory and load quite quickly to illustrate the website in the form of images. Video filetypes can be inappropriate as they 
        can cause a lag in the website to load as they can be quite high in memory. An alternative to video files could be a GIF file to 
        illustrate a short clip of what is trying to be shown as they are quite low in memory and can load quickly. It might be suggested that 
        if a webpage does require a video file it should keep these down to the minimum and absolute necessary.
